In this project I used Automobile sales dataset from Kaggle. Link of dataset on link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ddosad/auto-sales-data?resource=download 
Using SQL I analyzed sale revenue to create a customer segmentation analysis.

RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary analysis) is an indexing technique that uses past purchase behavior to segment customers. 
- Recency means how long ago their last purchase was
- Frequency means how often they purchase
- Monetary means how much they spent on their purchases

This project also included data analysis visualization in Tableu Desktop
